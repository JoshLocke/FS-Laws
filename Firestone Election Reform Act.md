**§7. ELECTION STRUCTURE**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Any and all elections that are run in the State of Firestone to fill seats inside the Executive or Legislative Branch will use either the Single Transferable Vote (STV), Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) or The First Past the Post (FPTP) voting systems to decide election results.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) The First Past the Post (FPTP) voting system will also be used in any and all elections for Speaker of the House. Also, if deemed the position will be open via election by the Lieutenant Governor or Speaker of The House respectfully, the positions of Speaker Pro Tempore and President Pro Tempore will use The First Past the Post (FPTP) voting system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) In any voting for positions within the State of Firestone that use the Single Transferable Vote (STV) or Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) voting systems, the citizens of the State of Firestone, if they choose to vote, will be provided with the official voting ballot as determined by the Election Sponsor. The citizens who choose to vote may rank their candidates, with 1 being the candidate they support the most and lower being less support. Citizens must support at least 1 person on the ballot, should they vote, and can rank as many candidates as they want before turning in their ballot. In any voting for positions in the State of Firestone that use The First Past the Post (FPTP) voting system for voting, each Citizen, if they chose to vote, will be provided with the official voting ballot as determined by the Election Sponsor. Citizens will pick one (1), and only one (1), person to support before turning in their ballot to vote Should any ballots be turned in that do not follow the guidelines above, they will be considered spoilt ballots, and will be discarded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Once voting closes, should the voting system be the Single Transferable Vote (STV) or Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) voting system, the number of votes OVERALL will be counted. Then, the following algorithm will be used to determine the number of votes needed to secure a seat: The number of candidates on the ballot divided by the number of overall votes plus one. (ex: 3/300 +1 = 101).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Single Transferable Voting system, when used, will operate in the following way: The algorithm in SECTION 2A is used to calculate the number of votes needed to win a seat. Votes are organized by 1st place choice by the Election Sponsor. If ANYONE is at or over the limit they win a seat. If not, skip to #7. If number of winners = number of seats open for election, the election ends. If the winners votes exceed the amount of votes needed to secure a seat, the excess votes will go to their next choice, if any. If there are no more choices on the ballot, the ballot will be removed outright. Excess votes will be defined as: “Votes casted for a candidate after they have reached the number of votes required to secure a seat.” After votes are relocated, repeat step #3. If nobody is at or over the winning threshold, then the person with the least amount of votes will be eliminated and their votes will be relocated to their next choice, if any. If there are no more choices on the ballot, the ballot will be removed outright. EXCEPTION: If there is only 1 candidate left, and 1 seat left, even if the candidate does not reach the threshold needed to secure a seat, they will be rewarded with a seat regardless. After votes are relocated, repeat step #3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Instant-Runoff Voting system, when used, will operate in the following way: The algorithm in SECTION 2A is used to calculate the number of votes needed to win a seat. Votes are organized by 1st place choice by the Election Sponsor. If ANYONE is at or over the limit they win the election. If not,
skip to #4. If nobody is at or over the winning threshold, then the person with the least amount of votes will be eliminated and their votes will be relocated to their
next choice, if any. If there are no more choices on the ballot, the ballot will be removed outright. EXCEPTION: If there is only 1 candidate left, and 1 seat left, even if the candidate does not reach the threshold needed to secure a seat, they will be declared the election winner regardless.After votes are relocated, repeat step #3.
