Select Committees may only be established for investigating misconduct, corruption, or criminal activity when it cannot be (or has been unreasonably) handled by the executive and/or judicial branches. This purpose must be stated in the establishing resolution, and a select committee may not exceed its purpose. The purpose of a select committee may be amended by a joint resolution.

Select Committees provisionally established shall immediately start operations and be filled with membership pursuant to § 7 of this act. Members added during this time shall remain after the passing of the joint resolution establishing the Select Committee. The provisionally established Select Committee shall suspend operations after seven (7) days if the joint resolution to establish the Select Committee has still not yet passed by both houses of Congress. If the joint resolution establishing the Select Committee fails Congress, the Select Committee shall be abolished and may not be provisionally authorized again.
