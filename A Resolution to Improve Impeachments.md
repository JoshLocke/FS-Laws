**§6 HOUSE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) For any and all impeachments, the Representative(s) who chief-sponsor the resolution will be referred to as “managers” and have the option to act as the prosecution in the Senate Impeachment trial. The managers have the burden of proof and must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is, in fact, guilty of all crimes presented within the resolution.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Should there be two or more chief-sponsors, they will vote and pick a “head manager”. The rest of the chief-sponsors will be managers. Should there only be one chief-sponsor, s/he will be “head manager” by default. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The process governing the vote to determine the "head manager" shall be determined by the House of Representitives. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) The head manager shall have authority over all managers, and can appoint and remove any and all managers. The Speaker of the House will also have this authority, but he may not remove managers, and he cannot add more than three (3) managers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There will be no more than five (5) managers, including the head manager, at a time. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Managers are strictly members of the House of Representatives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Upon passage of articles of impeachment in the House, the chief-sponsor(s) shall be mandated to propose an initial prosecuting team to the House of Representatives within 24 hours. Upon proposal of the initial prosecuting team, the Presiding Officer shall open the floor to discussion for 24 hours which Representatives can object to members of the initial prosecuting team. If there is no discussion or objections, then the initial prosecuting team shall be approved. Representatives can also “motion to call the previous question” to skip this process. If there is an objection to a member of the initial prosecuting team and a second to that objection, if the Representatives vote majority in favor of striking that individual from the prosecution, then they shall be removed and may not be added back to the prosecution. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The chief-sponsor(s) cannot be removed from the prosecution team, and shall have the authority to appoint and remove members of the prosecution after the initial prosecution is approved, without requiring approval from the full house.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Should the head manager be expelled, resigned, or otherwise is incapable of executing the duties of his job, the Speaker must appoint a new head manager.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) For any and all impeachments, said person(s) who have been impeached by the House of Representatives will be referred to as the “accused”, and will have the option to appoint any and all citizens as legal counsel. The accused will have the authority to manage his legal counsel, and may have no more than five (5) members on his legal counsel, excluding him/herself. The accused will be presumed innocent unless proven guilty via conviction. The accused will also hold the authority to waive his/her constitutional right to force the Senate to hear his/her testimony, if applicable, and done under free will.
